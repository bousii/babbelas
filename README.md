A programmer's worst nightmare, programming in reverse


Tasks:
--Learn wtf a programming language is made of
    --Compiled or interpreted?
        --using interpreted because it seems a lot easier to make as a beginner, can try to make a compiler for the same language later it seems
--Making the syntax of the language
    --How are variable declared?
    --How are for loops expressed?
    etc
